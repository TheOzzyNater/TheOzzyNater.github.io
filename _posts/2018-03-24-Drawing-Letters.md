**Drawing 2D and 3D Letters**

In today's lesson we went back to using Python with Turtle, and we learnt how to draw letters. We started off with 2D letters, which we would have learnt last week but most of our class was on the Battlefields trip. Drawing these 2D letters used the same technique that we used to draw the shapes, using Rotate left/right and forward. We then started drawing 3D letters, this was more difficult as you needed to essentially draw the same shape twice, although one had to be on top of the other. You also needed to draw lines between the two shapes, I havenâ€™t completed it yet.
