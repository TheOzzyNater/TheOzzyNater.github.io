    <td> In this lesson I just did what I normally do, read the instructions and  ask questions when I found something hard, normally I asked Arvin because I sit next to him in class and he is very helpful. I also learnt by helping other people as I found ways in which I could've done something more quick.</td>

    <td> I started chatting to Arvin, it was mostly about work but it still limited the amount of time I spent typing, I really need to be able to just get down to business because I sometimes feel that I’m quite far behind a few people.  </td>
