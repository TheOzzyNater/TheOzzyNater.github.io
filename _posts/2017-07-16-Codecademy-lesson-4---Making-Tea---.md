    <td>In this lesson we were at the front of the room for the whole lesson to listen to Mr Keen telling us how computers understand code that they're given. It was funny because he asked us how you’re supposed to make a cup of tea and pretty much all of us got it wrong because we were assuming that the computer had tea bags, milk, a kettle etc. He drew diagrams to help us understand how a computer reads and interprets code.   </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Nothing, I think Mr Keen intended for us to be 'stupid’ because then it would be easier for him to show what you do and for us to understand it. If someone had immediately got it it would’ve been harder to understand as we would be expected to know what that person had said and it wouldn’t be explained.</td>
