    <td> I asked a lot of questions in this lesson, I think maybe I asked too many, no one seemed to be annoyed though. I also learnt today through searching things up on the internet, not answers, only what certain errors meant.</td>

    <td> I will make sure I've drunk and eaten enough to give me more energy after Lunch as that's when I’m most tired. Also I will ask less questions as I won’t want to annoy anyone.</td>
