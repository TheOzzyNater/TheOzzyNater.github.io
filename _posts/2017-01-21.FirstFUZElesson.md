    <td>Me and my partner, Marcus were using the FUZE manual to help us, we mainly used code in the book but we understood the principles of coding with FUZE and we enjoyed ourselves. It was amazing seeing how simple code may look sometimes but learning that it was actually very hard to do.

    <td>Marcus was messing around a lot meaning we didn't get as far into the manual as I would have liked to, to be honest I was messing around a bit to, so that hindered us. I’m still happy with what we did though. The screen was really zoomed in so we didn’t know everything that was going on.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I’ll try and pick a monitor that isn’t really zoomed in next time! I’ll try and get myself and Marcus to focus more so we won’t be behind everyone else going into later, more important lessons. I’ll try and use past knowledge so I can write my own code. </td>
