**Learning Python**

In today's lesson we learnt how to code conversations in Python, these conversations included functions like input, print, else, elif and else. We made 3 extra little conversations on certain topics between the two. Here is an example of one of the conversations:

name = input("Good Morning! What is your name?")

print("Good Morning " + name + "!")

color = input("What is your favourite colour?")

print(color + " is my favourite colour too!")
