    <td>We went through the different numbers in turn so we knew which numbers moved what part of the robot arm.

  <tr>
    <td>I didn't really remember what each number made the robot arm do, it limited my learning because it made my videos really slow because I was working out how to do the movements every time instead of doing one fluid motion. Marcus was messing around a lot meaning we didn’t get as far into the manual as I would have liked to, to be honest I was messing around a bit to, so that hindered us. I’m still happy with what we did though. The screen was really zoomed in so we didn’t know everything that was going on.</td>
