    <td> I fully read the descriptions and instructions so I could learn what to do as I went along. This will probably stop me from having to go back to look at past exercises, so in turn I will get more exercises done in the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Like normal, 5th period is the lesson which most people find it hard to concentrate in as it's the end of the day and I'm always thinking about what I’m going to do when I get home from school. To fix this I need to just enjoy lessons more so I don’t think about the end of the day.</td>
